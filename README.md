# SetGame
Stanford CS193p Spring 2021 (assignments 3&amp;4)

## Notes

1. Implemented all the required tasks and most of the extra credits.
2. Keep the two-player mode through both assignments to because of the fun of competition between two guys. (would be better to provide a mode switch button)

## Features:
* **Two-player mode**: Each player should press the "_Found!_" button before selection, otherwise no cards can be selected.
* **Deal cards**: tap the "_deck_"
* **Restart**: long tap the "_deck_"
* **Hint**: long tap the "_discarded pile_" (cannot be triggered at the first round)
